## 🛠️ The Bug That Became The Tool

This project started out of sheer **frustration with persistent bugs** in [Shipping Manager](https://shippingmanager.cc) and the complete lack of ongoing development by the creators.

Initially, I just wanted to build a **simple chat messenger** – something that would allow me to communicate with my alliance on Steam without constantly worrying about certain keystrokes triggering a full page reload (a well-known bug in the Steam Version that never gets fixed).

What truly annoyed me was the inability to log in through a standard browser using my Steam account to receive game notifications while moving around the house or to earn **Point Rewards from Ads on my mobile device**.

Given that I have paid money for in-game items, it felt a bit like **"I got scammed."** I decided: I want to create my own benefits, especially since I can't watch ads to earn points or even receive notifications while I'm at home...

Well... things got a little out of hand, and the result is what you see here now :-D

This **comprehensive standalone web interface** connects directly to the Shipping Manager API and is packed with features the normal game is missing.

### 📢 A Message to Trophy Games

> **@Dear Trophy Games**
>
> As a dedicated player and Steam user, I would highly appreciate seeing **premium features**, like the ones integrated here, fully and natively implemented into your system.
>
> Imagine 10,000 active players willing to pay 5 Euros monthly for such integrated features — that could generate an extra **50,000 Euros per month**. A business model that would be worthwhile for everyone!
>
> I warmly invite you to **cooperate**: If you appreciate some of my feature ideas and would like assistance integrating them into the official system, I am readily available.
>
> Furthermore, since *Shipping Manager* is a simulation, it would be wonderful if you would make your **API documentation** publicly accessible. This would allow the community to develop valuable UI extensions themselves without unnecessarily burdening your API with reverse engineering calls. Sorry about some potentially log spam in the past :P

- Active Shipping Manager account on Steam (alliance membership optional)

That's it! The installer includes everything else you need.

### Developers & Linux/Mac Users (Running from Source)
- **Installation Guide**: See [docs/tutorials/installation-guide.md](docs/tutorials/installation-guide.md)
- **Build Guide**: See [docs/tutorials/build-guide.md](docs/tutorials/build-guide.md)

- Click the docs button in the UI (next to settings)

The documentation includes build instructions, installation guides, and complete API reference for all modules.

## Session Cookie Encryption

**All session cookies are automatically encrypted using OS-native secure storage!**

### How It Works

Session cookies are stored in `userdata/settings/sessions.json` (or `AppData/Local/ShippingManagerCoPilot/userdata/settings/sessions.json` when installed) but **never in plaintext**. The file only contains encrypted references like `KEYRING:session_1234567`. The actual cookie values are securely stored in your operating system's credential manager.

### Cross-Platform Security Backends

The application automatically uses the most secure storage available for your platform:

#### **Windows**
- **Backend**: Windows DPAPI (Data Protection API) + Credential Manager
- **Security**: Encrypted with your Windows user account credentials
- **Access**: Only you on this specific machine can decrypt
- **Location**: Windows Credential Manager (`Control Panel > Credential Manager`)

#### **macOS**
- **Backend**: macOS Keychain
- **Security**: Encrypted with Keychain encryption
- **Access**: Only you on this specific machine can decrypt
- **Location**: Keychain Access app

#### **Linux**
- **Backend**: libsecret (GNOME Keyring / KWallet)
- **Security**: Encrypted with Secret Service API
- **Access**: Only you on this specific machine can decrypt
- **Requirements**: `libsecret-1-dev` package must be installed

#### **Fallback Encryption**
If OS keyring is unavailable:
- Uses AES-256-GCM encryption with machine-specific key
- Key derived from: hostname + username + platform
- Still significantly more secure than plaintext

### Benefits

- **No plaintext cookies**: Even if someone copies your `sessions.json`, they cannot use it
- **Machine-locked**: Cookies can only be decrypted on the same machine by the same user
- **Zero configuration**: Works automatically, no setup required
- **New sessions protected**: All newly saved sessions are encrypted immediately

## Known Game Bugs & Tracking

**Harbor Fee Bug Detection & Documentation**

It appears the API returns a harbor fee value that is not used for the actual in-game calculations. From the outside, it looks like someone forgot to set a percentage or decimal places correctly for the UI display.

The amount credited in-game is not identical to what should have been deducted if the displayed harbor fee were correct and actually used for calculations. This suggests the API response contains incorrect or display-only harbor fee values.

When this bug is detected, the application:
- Displays the bug in-game with full details
- Logs the entire transaction in a separate file
- Preserves the complete API call and response for investigation
- Prevents duplicate logging of the same harbor bug
- Provides meaningful information that can be shared with Trophy Games for bug fixing
